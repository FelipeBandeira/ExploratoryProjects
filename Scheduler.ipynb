    "This project was created to explore applications of heaps and practice computational skills, such as complexity analysis and object-oriented programming. By using heaps, I created a scheduler to organize the daily tasks of a person in the most productive way. Productivity here is evaluated based on the amount of utility that a sequence of tasks provide. Supposing a person lists more tasks than they have time to complete, the scheduler uses a greedy approach to determine which combination is the most optimal.\n",

    "The first advantage of using a heap comes in the initial structuring of the data. From an array with random values, it is possible to build a heap in O(n) time. On the other hand, if we decided to sort the array to obtain its greatest/smallest value, the fastest algorithms we know (merge sort, quick sort, heap sort) would take O(n log n) time, which is slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must note that creating a heap is different from sorting an array. A heap structures information hierarchically, sorting chunks of elements relative to each other; in a max heap, for example, parent nodes are always greater than their children, but there is no rule determining in which position the greater child should be. Still, for creating a scheduler, there is no need to sort all elements. Instead, we only need to obtain the greatest/smallest element of the group (which is our next task). A heap, therefore, is faster and well-suited for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, heaps are also better in terms of handling streaming data. It is common for new activities to come up in a day, which requires reorganizing the schedule from that moment on. Heaps can insert elements in O(log n) time. On the other hand, if we used a sorted array to define priority, our best options would be inserting the element with insertion sort (which would take time O(n) time), or appending it to the list and re-sorting it all over again (which would take, with the best sorting algorithms, O(n log n) time). Once again, heaps perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only benefit of using a sorted array is that the time for removing an element is O(1), while a heap demands O(log n) because it needs to reorganize the heap (\"heapify\") after the removal. Even this advantage, however, can be questioned: the time of O(1) only happens when removing the last element of the array. Removing the first would require shifting the position of all subsequent elements, which would take O(n) time.\n",

    "The task scheduler starts by taking as input a list of objects. Its very first step is calculating the priority each task should have. The process of calculating priority values is detailed in the following section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once priority values are calculated, the scheduler separates tasks into groups. In every routine, there are mainly two kinds of tasks: fixed ones, which start at a specific time of the day (such as having classes), and flexible ones, which can be done at any time. If a task is flexible and contains dependencies, it is placed on a \"waitlist\" until all its dependencies are concluded. However, if a flexible task does not depend on any other, the scheduler puts it in a max heap. All tasks in a heap are ready to be executed, and the next task chosen is the one with the highest priority value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed tasks work slightly differently. A fixed task might have dependencies, but it will happen regardless of those. For example, before attending a class, a person might want to do prework. However, the class will happen regardless of whether the person did their prework. For that reason, fixed tasks are placed in a min heap right away and are prioritized based on the time they should start. The dependencies of fixed tasks are essential in determining the utility value of flexible tasks, but they do not prevent the fixed task (such as the class) from happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this process is over and both heaps are ready, the algorithm compares both heap roots. Specifically, it answers the question: can we complete the next flexible task and have 10 minutes of rest before the beginning of the next fixed task? If yes, the algorithm determines the next task to be the flexible one, and if not, the fixed one. This task is extracted from its heap and printed on the user's screen. The scheduler's clock is also updated, and the task is removed from the dependencies of all tasks in the waitlist.\n",
    "\n",
    "When running again, the algorithm first checks if it's time for a break. It then evaluates if any tasks in the waitlist are now ready to be moved to the heap, places them in, and the whole comparison process starts again. This algorithm repeats itself until no tasks are left on the waitlist or the heaps."

    "The first variable used to calculate utility is the duration of the task. The more tasks I do, the more satisfied I feel, which means utility is inversely proportional to the duration of a task. Consequently: This makes: <br><br><center>__priority = 1/duration__<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second variable that must be factored in is the nature of the task. Academics are my priority at Minerva (weight 5), but I also need work-study to pay for my tuition (weight 3), and routine tasks are unavoidable (weight 1). The formula, as a consequence, becomes:\n",
    "<br><br><center>__priority = base category weight/duration__<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from aspects inherent to each activity, their relative importance also plays a role in the utility they provide (after all, it is extremely rewarding to complete a task that \"unlocks\" several others). The relative importance of a task is measured by the number of times it appears in the dependencies of others, multiplied by the category weight of the tasks they unlock. For example, a task that unlocks an academic activity is more relevant than a task that unlocks a routine activity. The more activities containing a specific ID in their dependencies, the greater that ID's relative importance.\n",
    "<br><br><center>__priority = (category weight * relative importance)/duration__<br>\n",

    "The last step of the calculation involves mitigating psychological biases. Given that fixed tasks will happen regardless of their dependencies having been completed (such as a class happening regardless of a student doing their prework), there is an emotional risk involved in not scheduling a day correctly. For example, being in a meeting without adequate preparation can be draining. \n",
    "    \n",
    "However, due to overconfidence, I tend to act in a risk-seeking manner, wrongly believing I can accomplish more in a day than what is indeed feasible. To avoid the risk of prioritizing quicker tasks, instead of comprehensively meaningful activities, the relative importance of each task is weighted. Any activity a fixed task depends on is ten times relatively more important than an activity required by a flexible task. Therefore:\n",
    "<br><br><center>__priority = (category weight * weighted relative importance)/duration__<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using such a framework for calculating utility mitigates biases and tackles delays and unforeseeable situations. By correctly evaluating tasks and executing the most important ones first, I decrease the risk of finishing the day without meaningful tasks being accomplished. If the city runs out of power, traffic is hectic, or a friend is celebrating their birthday at the end of the day, I face a smaller tradeoff on not doing the last activities I had planned; the ones I did at the beginning of the day were more important, after all.\n"

    "Using an algorithm to determine one's daily schedule has advantages that cannot be ignored. The first lies on how decision-making becomes rational rather than emotional: events that cause frustration or anger, for example, do not distract us from optimal choices. By applying the same criteria to all tasks, we ensure the path followed is the best, maximizing the utility obtained. It also decreases the time necessary to choose what to do next: for undecided people, this is especially useful, saving a lot of time and mental energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are limitations still not addressed by the scheduler. The first relates to how the utility formula is still far from optimal. The cognitive process that evaluates utility is more complex than I understand. As a consequence, the sequence determined by the schedule might not be the one that would maximize utility in real life. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, even though the scheduler allows for unforeseen tasks to be added in the middle of the day, it does not incorporate delays and actual execution times. If a bus takes too long to come or a task takes less time than planned, the scheduler needs to incorporate this information and adjust the predictions for the next activities according to it. Not doing so makes the times printed in the schedule imprecise and leads to a third failure mode: not considering the possibility that some tasks won't be executed. It is normal that plans and conditions change, which makes a day diverge from the plan. Currently, the schedule does not support the removal of a scheduled task, which makes it unrealistic if an activity has to be skipped: not executing a task would lead to different utility calculations, priorities, and a different sequence of activities.\n",

Every time a task is completed, the scheduler evaluates the list of dependent tasks to clear their dependencies. This is done with a for loop, which runs through all tasks in the list, even though many of them might not have in their dependency the task that was just completed. \n",

    "__Algorithmic strategy__: First, I explained why using two heaps, instead of one, was better for the context of this problem. I then explained in simple terms how the algorithm should work, described the structure in which the heaps would be inserted (the other parts of the scheduler, such as the dependency checking process), and devised a strategy that reduces runtime (inserting elements without dependencies straight into the heap, and then avoiding unnecessary checking by remove_dependencies). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Computational critique__: First, I discussed two possible ways of creating a scheduler (using a sorted list or a heap) and theoretically detailed why one of them was better. I also compared the pros and cons of each approach, acknowledging that the other approach had a strength that heaps did not (popping in heap requires heapifying (O(log n)), while in a sorted array it's O(1)). After the implementation, I created experiments that showed a time complexity of θ(n^2). I explained why the scheduler's complexity was greater than a heap's complexity (the full algorithm is more than just the heaps), identified which part of the algorithm caused a bottleneck, and showed how the complexity would change to θ(n) if that problem was solved. Last, I explained how an improvement could be made using a graph, detailing how that data structure would help eliminate the algorithm's bottleneck.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Python programming__: I created two classes from scratch (Task and TaskScheduler), implemented their methods, and adjusted both so that they would work together smoothly. As we were instructed not to use external libraries, I created ways to convert time into a format that can be computed (from string to int). To prove that the code works, I created an assert statement to show that different inputs would result in the same schedule. I devised ways to reduce the space usage of the algorithm (instead of storing all tasks, I just keep in memory the ones that are not yet in the heaps) and decrease its runtime. Overall, through OOP, I implemented a sophisticated working schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Code readability__: the entire algorithm was crafted to be clean and easy to read. Comments were added to justify algorithmic choices or clarify aspects that were not trivial. Docstrings were used to illustrate the functionality of each method. Whenever possible, blocks of code were transformed into separate methods to facilitate understanding. All variables are appropriately named and, in the only method that is unusually large (execute_task), a docstring and a few comments illustrate the way it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Professionalism__: I produced a written report and .ipynb file containing explanations and code. No matter which one the reader chooses, it is complete, detailed, and easy to understand. The language used in both was direct and professional. APA standards were applied in the written report, following all of Minerva's guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Complexity analysis__:  I correctly inferred the theoretical scaling growth of the scheduler, identifying which part of the algorithm caused the time complexity of θ(n^2), and later implemented experiments to demonstrate that. I also correctly noted that the complexity would be reduced in case a specific problem was solved, and also demonstrated that experimentally. Last, I explained what scaling growth was and why we could describe the algorithm's complexity using the Big Theta notation, connecting it to the Big-O and Big Omega notations and the concepts of upper/lower bounds."
